# wild-exception
Create a custom exception and throw.

# Objective Summary

## Challenge

You will need to create your own `CustomException` that contains a message and a property of type `DateTime`, representing the time the exception was thrown (`throw new...`).

In your main program, create a function `ThrowError()` that simply throws a `CustomException` with the appropriate information.

Call this function from the `Main` method, ensuring it is properly wrapped in a try/catch block, and display the date and message of the exception in the console.
